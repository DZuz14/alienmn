I can see you're working on the NavBar component and want to mute the white text color on hover. Let me first look at the current NavBar component to understand the styling.

I can see the issue! On line 19, you have `hover:text-white-` which is incomplete - it's missing the opacity value. To mute the white text on hover, you can use Tailwind's opacity utilities. Here are a few options:

1. `hover:text-white/80` - 80% opacity (20% muted)
2. `hover:text-white/70` - 70% opacity (30% muted) 
3. `hover:text-gray-300` - A lighter gray instead of white

Let me fix this for you:

```

Perfect! I've fixed the incomplete `hover:text-white-` class by changing it to `hover:text-white/70`. This will make the white text appear at 70% opacity (30% muted) when you hover over the navigation links.

The `/70` syntax is Tailwind's way of applying opacity - it's equivalent to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)`. If you want it more or less muted, you can adjust the number:
- `hover:text-white/80` for less muted (80% opacity)
- `hover:text-white/60` for more muted (60% opacity)
- `hover:text-white/50` for even more muted (50% opacity)

The hover effect should now work properly!
